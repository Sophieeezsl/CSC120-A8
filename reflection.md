Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?

For House, I overloaded:

1. moveIn: to allow moving in a student by just their name

2. nResidents to optionally print out all resident names

I chose these because they make interacting with a House more user-friendly, without changing the original logic.

For Library, I overloaded:

1. addTitle to allow adding a book and setting its availability at the same time

2. checkOut to allow specifying the number of days a book is checked out

I chose these because they provide more realistic options for managing a library collection, like setting an initial availability status or tracking borrowing durations.

For Cafe, I overloaded:

sellCoffee to allow 1. selling coffee with just size or 2. size plus sugar

I chose these to make ordering more flexible, depending on how specific the coffee order needs to be.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I think the most difficult part of this assignment was to "keep track" of everything.
Every parameter, field, and method needed to match exactly to run. It was also important to keep track of which classes were extending from Building, and to make sure that every subclass correctly inherited and overrode methods when needed.
